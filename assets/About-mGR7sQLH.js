Designed to help users stay organized and productive, this app reflects my journey as a developer exploring modern web technologies. This project is crafted with Vue.js and powered by Vue SSG for fast, static site generation. The layout and components are styled using Flowbite, ensuring a clean, responsive, and accessible user interface. For hosting, the app runs seamlessly on GitHub Pages, making it lightweight and easy to access anywhere. On the backend, My ToDo App connects to a PHP API server deployed on Wasmer, providing secure and efficient task management functionality. Together, these technologies create a simple yet powerful productivity tool that demonstrates how modern frameworks and cloud platforms can work in harmony. </p><p class="mb-4 font-light"> This app is the beginning of my development journey - a foundation for future projects where usability, performance, and design come together to help people achieve more every day. </p></div></div>',1)])])}const p=t(n,[["render",i]]);export{p as default};
